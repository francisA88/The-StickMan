Please note that some of these animations donâ€™t actually work like they are supposed to. If you can please correct them.

".anim" files are the previous files used in the animation instructions. They still work, but not as well as their xml counterparts. Also, a transpiler that converts .anim to .xml exists in ../parser folder.
